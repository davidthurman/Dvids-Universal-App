                    DefenseTV is powered by DVIDSHub.net - Since 2004, DVIDS (Defense Video and Imagery Distribution System, operated by U.S. Army Central) has provided world media with reliable access to all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and coalition partners serving overseas, helping fulfill the military’s obligation to provide maximum disclosure of information with minimum delay. With the use of today’s newest broadcast technologies and satellite capabilities provided to deployed units, and a distribution hub in Atlanta, Georgia, DVIDS makes available real-time broadcast-quality video, still images and print products, as well as immediate interview opportunities with service members, commanders and subject matter experts.
